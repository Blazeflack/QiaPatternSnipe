# How to use
Open settings with `/qia`. While enabled, interacting with Qia will quickly scan for the desired limited items and buy them if available. Merchant frame is automatically closed after each interaction, allowing you to simply right click the NPC in order to scan and purchase the items.

**Pro Tip:** Set a keybind to interact with target and simply press that keybind while you watch something on your 2nd monitor.
